## **Invincible** ![Alt text](https://ew.com/thmb/loLVuN94pMyDrFUxkFFJOKuouRo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/invincible-promo-072023-1-d0957bb94a0545a080a58d3a610e5966.jpg) <h6> One of the reasons on why I have choose this as my favorite series is because of how good the story writing is, how great the story telling especially the voice actors in the show! Even the name "Invincible" means incapable of being defeated, overcome, or subdued; it describes something or someone that is virtually unbeatable or impossible to conquer. Which perfectly describes Mark. It's very peak. </h6>
## *Bridge to Terabithia* ![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*EuMFNj7L9wYyEVb4aO5vAg.jpeg) <h6> My favorite childhood movie, why? because Bridge to Terabithia is about Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke, two fifth-graders who become friends and create an imaginary land called Terabithia, where they can go to forget about their problems. Which reminds me of Maddy where we will go play "this game" where we can meet to escape real life. </h6>
## *Arcane* ![Alt text](https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/11/artwork-1718103614515.jpeg) <h6> Not only I love playing LoL, Wildrit. But now they have a series that I guess every LoL players have been waiting for! The show is peak, even though Invincible is more peak ngl. Amid the stark discord of twin cities Piltover and Zaun, two sisters fight on rival sides of a war between magic technologies and clashing convictions. </h6>
